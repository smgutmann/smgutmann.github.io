Hello and thanks for visiting! I'm a scientist living in Switzerland and I love paragliding. During the global corona virus pandemic we are forced to stay distant from loved ones and to pause many of our recreational acitivties. So there is plenty of time to write, read, and tinker with a personal webpage. Here's mine. I intend to blog regularly about scientific topics.

Stay tuned, curious and healthy!
